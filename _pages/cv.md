Education
======
* Masters of Science in Physics, University of Texas at Dallas, 2022
* Bachelors of Science in Physics, Purdue University, 2020

Research Experience
======
* 2021-2022: Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)
  - Used the publicly available python code BAO_Fitter_dev to fit the Baryon AcousticOscillation (BAO) of the Power Spectra of the eBOSS DR12 spectroscopic data using python and made edits to perform a chi-squared minimization.
  - Measured power spectra on the NERSC Cori HPC using mock data for the upcoming DESI spectroscopic survey for use by the collaboration using the python package PyPower and performed reconstruction using PyRecon.
  - Performed fits of the BAO feature on the NERSC Cori HPC of these power spectra using the publicly available code BARRY and presented the results to the collaboration

* 2022: CMB Machine Learning
  - Provided physics expertise in collaboration with the computer science department to create a code that uses spherical CNN to clean data from astrophysical surveys such as the PLANCK mission.

* 2019-2020: Research Assistant
  - Used Python to analyze data from a cosmological simulation to study the distribution of protocluster galaxies and how such distributions might appear in real observational data.
  - Designed a gaussian convolution smoothing function to visualize the data and search for distribution patterns.
  - Calculated the expected redshift range detected by a narrow band filter in order to construct the expected line of sight.

* 2018: CMS Research
  - Conducted and improved multiple thermal experiments in an attempt to measure the gradient of a carbon fiber-based material for the inner silicon pixel detector in the LHC high luminosity phase.
  - Analyzed data from the thermal experiments to map the thermal gradient.
  - Designed, tested and analyzed ANSYS FEA simulations of the carbon fiber material and compared the simulation to thermal gradient and mechanical stress experiments carried out in the lab.

Course Projects
======
* Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Code
  - Wrote a code to fit the BAO signature in the power spectra of the eBOSS
DR12 using chi-squared minimization and presented results.

  - Wrote a review article in APA format using LATEX about the creation of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the primordial plasma.
* Charles W. Misner Presentation
  - Presented a review and summary of the work and influence of Charles W. Misner in the field of physics.
